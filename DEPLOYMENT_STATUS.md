**Commit**: 388d97d - "Fix build errors and deployment issues"
**Date**: October 11, 2025

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Component Import Errors
- ✅ Fixed `AuthForm`, `SubmitButton`, and `toast` exports in `components/index.ts`
- ✅ Updated imports in login and register pages

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors

- ✅ Removed unsupported `maxTokens` parameter from chat route
- ✅ Added missing model definitions (`title-model`, `artifact-model`)

### 4. Provider Configuration
- ✅ Simplified provider setup for AI SDK compatibility
- ✅ Fixed model resolution logic

## 📦 Build Status

✅ **Local Build**: Successful
✅ **Git Push**: Successful
⏳ **Vercel Deployment**: In Progress (automatic)

## 🌐 Vercel Deployment

Since your Vercel project is connected to this GitHub repository, it should automatically:

1. Detect the new push
2. Start a new deployment
3. Build with your configured environment variables
4. Deploy to production

### Check Deployment Status:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Check the "Deployments" tab
4. You should see a new deployment in progress

### Required Environment Variables (Already Configured):

- ✅ `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection
- ✅ `GROQ_API_KEY` - AI model API key
- ✅ `AUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- ✅ `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - File storage (optional)
- ✅ `REDIS_URL` - Caching (optional)

## 🚀 Expected Outcome

Once Vercel finishes building (usually 2-5 minutes):

- Your app will be live at your Vercel URL
- All build errors should be resolved
- The app should work with your configured environment variables

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Vercel Dashboard** - Watch the deployment progress
2. **Check Build Logs** - If any issues occur, check the build logs in Vercel
3. **Test Production** - Once deployed, test your production URL
4. **Verify Features**:
   - Authentication (login/register)
   - Chat functionality
   - AI responses
   - File uploads (if configured)

## 📚 Documentation Added

- `LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Local development setup
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions
- `VERCEL_SETUP.md` - Vercel-specific setup
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Detailed list of fixes

## 🎉 Summary

All code issues have been fixed and pushed to GitHub. Vercel should automatically deploy your app within the next few minutes. Check your Vercel dashboard for the deployment status and production URL!
