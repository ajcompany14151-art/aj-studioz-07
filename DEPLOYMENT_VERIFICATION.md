## 📊 Build Verification

### Local Build Test Results
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
```

**Note**: Local build fails at "Collecting page data" due to invalid `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env.local`, but this is expected. The important part is that TypeScript compilation and linting passed.

### Vercel Build Expectations
On Vercel with proper environment variables:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation will succeed
- ✅ Database connection will work (valid `POSTGRES_URL`)
- ✅ Build will complete successfully
- ✅ Deployment will go live

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required on Vercel

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:

### Required (Must Have)
- ✅ `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection string
- ✅ `GROQ_API_KEY` - AI model API key  
- ✅ `AUTH_SECRET` - Authentication secret

### Optional (Nice to Have)
- ⚪ `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` - For file uploads
- ⚪ `REDIS_URL` - For caching
