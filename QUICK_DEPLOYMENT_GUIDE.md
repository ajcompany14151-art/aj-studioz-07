# Quick Deployment Guide - AI Models Fix

## What Was Fixed? ✅

Your AI chatbot was only using **Lynxa Lite** (basic model) and was missing the main powerful models. This has been fixed!

### Now Available:
1. **🎯 Lynxa Lite** - Fast ChatGPT-style (was already there)
2. **🚀 Lynxa Pro** - Powerful with artifacts (**NEW - now default**)
3. **🎓 Lynxa Student Pro** - Advanced reasoning (**NEW**)

### Also Added:
- ✅ 5-key API rotation for 5x more capacity
- ✅ Automatic failover on rate limits
- ✅ Full artifact support
- ✅ Step-by-step reasoning

## Deploy in 3 Steps 🚀

### Step 1: Get Groq API Keys
1. Go to https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign in
3. Create **5 API keys** (or at least 1)
4. Copy each key (starts with `gsk_`)

### Step 2: Add to Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Click **Environment Variables**
3. Add these (at minimum add the first one):
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY = gsk_your_first_key
   GROQ_API_KEY_2 = gsk_your_second_key  (optional)
   GROQ_API_KEY_3 = gsk_your_third_key   (optional)
   GROQ_API_KEY_4 = gsk_your_fourth_key  (optional)
   GROQ_API_KEY_5 = gsk_your_fifth_key   (optional)
   ```
4. Check all environments: Production, Preview, Development
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Wait for "Ready" status

## Test Your Fix ✅

1. Open your chatbot
2. Click the model selector (top of chat)
3. You should see:
   - ⚡ Lynxa Lite
   - 🚀 Lynxa Pro (selected by default)
   - 🎓 Lynxa Student Pro
4. Send a test message
5. AI should respond!

## Check API Key Rotation

Look at Vercel function logs:
- Should see: `[Groq] Initialized with X API key(s)`
- If rate limited: `[Groq] Marked key #N as rate-limited`

## Benefits 🎉

### With 1 Key:
- ✅ All 3 models work
- ✅ 100,000 tokens per day

### With 5 Keys:
- ✅ All 3 models work
- ✅ 500,000 tokens per day (5x more!)
- ✅ Automatic failover
- ✅ Better reliability

## Troubleshooting

### AI Still Not Responding?
1. ✓ Did you add GROQ_API_KEY?
2. ✓ Did you click Save?
3. ✓ Did you Redeploy?
4. ✓ Did you wait for "Ready" status?
5. ✓ Did you hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)?

### Only See Lynxa Lite?
- The code is updated, but you need to redeploy for changes to take effect

### Rate Limit Errors?
- Add more API keys (GROQ_API_KEY_2 through GROQ_API_KEY_5)
- System will automatically rotate between them

## Model Comparison

| Feature | Lite | Pro | Student Pro |
|---------|------|-----|-------------|
| Speed | ⚡ Fast | 🚀 Medium | 🚀 Medium |
| Artifacts | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Reasoning | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Best For | Quick chat | Code/tasks | Learning |
| Default? | No | **Yes** | No |

## What's an Artifact?

When you ask Lynxa Pro or Student Pro to create something, they generate:
- 📝 Documents (markdown, guides)
- 💻 Code (HTML, JS, Python, React)
- 📊 Spreadsheets (CSV, tables)

These appear in a side panel you can edit, export, and save.
