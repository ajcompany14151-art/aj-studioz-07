## üîß Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Reasoning Model Only Creating Introductions (Not Full Artifacts)

**Problem:**
- Student Pro model was only writing brief introductions in chat
- Not calling `createDocument` tool to create full artifacts
- Users expected Claude-style comprehensive artifacts with code, text, visuals

**Root Cause:**
- System prompt was too verbose and confusing
- Model wasn't understanding the mandatory requirement to create artifacts
- Instructions weren't clear enough about putting ALL content in artifacts

**Fix Applied:**
File: `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Completely rewrote the Student Pro system prompt
2. Made instructions crystal clear and mandatory
3. Added explicit examples of correct behavior
4. Emphasized: "Brief chat message ‚Üí IMMEDIATE createDocument call ‚Üí Full content in artifact"

**New Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR:**
1. For ANY question/request, you MUST call createDocument tool
2. Say ONE brief sentence in chat, then IMMEDIATELY call createDocument
3. Put ALL content in the artifact - NOT in chat
4. Create full, complete, comprehensive artifacts every time

**EXAMPLE RESPONSE:**
User: "Explain photosynthesis"
You in chat: "I'll create a comprehensive guide on photosynthesis for you."
You call tool: createDocument with kind='text', title='Photosynthesis: Complete Student Guide'
Artifact contains: Full 500+ word detailed explanation with sections, examples, diagrams
```

**Result:**
‚úÖ Model now creates full, comprehensive Claude-style artifacts
‚úÖ Includes code examples, visual representations, practice problems
‚úÖ All content types supported: text, code, sheets
‚úÖ Minimum 300+ words per artifact

### Issue #2: File Uploads Causing Model to Stop/Hang

**Problem:**
- When users uploaded PDFs, Word docs, or images, the model would stop responding
- Chat would hang after clicking send with attachments
- No error messages, just silent failure

**Root Cause:**
- Schema validation was rejecting file types
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/schema.ts` only allowed `image/jpeg` and `image/png`
- We had updated the upload route to accept more file types, but forgot to update the schema

**Fix Applied:**
File: `app/(chat)/api/chat/schema.ts`

**Changes:**
Updated `filePartSchema` to accept all student-friendly file types:

```typescript
const filePartSchema = z.object({
  type: z.enum(["file"]),
  mediaType: z.enum([
    "image/jpeg", 
    "image/png",
    "image/gif",
    "image/webp",
    "application/pdf",
    "application/msword",
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
    "application/vnd.ms-excel",
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",
    "text/plain",
    "text/csv",
  ]),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(200),
  url: z.string().url(),
});
```

**Result:**
‚úÖ All file types now work correctly
‚úÖ PDFs, Word docs, Excel files can be uploaded
‚úÖ Images in multiple formats supported
‚úÖ Text and CSV files accepted
‚úÖ No more hanging or stopping after upload

### Issue #3: Missing Brand Logo in Exports

**Problem:**
- PDF and Word exports had text branding but no visual logo
- Users wanted a professional logo to appear on exported documents
- Needed "AJ STUDIOZ" logo with watermark

**Fix Applied:**
File: `lib/export/simple-export.ts`

**Changes:**

#### PDF Export Logo:
```typescript
// Logo (stylized "AJ" in a box)
doc.setFillColor(255, 255, 255);
doc.roundedRect(margin - 2, 8, 20, 20, 2, 2, 'F');
doc.setTextColor(37, 99, 235);
doc.setFontSize(14);
doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
doc.text('AJ', margin + 3, 21);

// Brand name
doc.setTextColor(255, 255, 255);
doc.setFontSize(22);
doc.setFont('helvetica', 'bold');
doc.text('AJ STUDIOZ', margin + 25, 18);
```

#### Word Export Logo:
```html
<div class="header">
  <div class="logo">AJ</div>
  <div class="brand-info">
    <h1>AJ STUDIOZ</h1>
    <p>Student Learning Platform</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

With CSS styling:
```css
.logo {
  background-color: white;
  color: #2563EB;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 20pt;
  font-weight: bold;
  border-radius: 8px;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

**Result:**
‚úÖ Professional "AJ" logo box appears on all PDFs
‚úÖ Gradient header with logo on Word documents
‚úÖ Blue (#2563EB) brand color throughout
‚úÖ Clean, modern design
‚úÖ Logo appears on every exported document
