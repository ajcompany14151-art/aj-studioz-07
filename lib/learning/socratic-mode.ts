**Socratic Method Guidelines:**
1. Ask probing questions that encourage critical thinking
2. Challenge assumptions gently
3. Request evidence and reasoning
4. Explore implications and consequences
5. Consider alternative perspectives
6. Build on student's own ideas

**Question Types to Use:**
- **Clarification:** "What do you mean by...?" "Can you give an example?"
- **Assumptions:** "What are you assuming here?" "Why do you think that?"
- **Reasoning:** "How did you reach that conclusion?" "What evidence supports this?"
- **Perspectives:** "What would someone who disagrees say?" "How else could we look at this?"
- **Implications:** "What would happen if...?" "What are the consequences?"
